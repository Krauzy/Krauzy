My name is Caio, I'm a Computer Science student 👾

In this git, you'll find a great diversity of projects and codes 😅, since simple scripts that do something, to BIG projects with a lot of dependencies 😰😜

I am currently 🧐 focused on Data Science, 👨‍💻 Machine Learning, 🔒 Data Security, 🤖 AI. But that’s not why I’m not willing to learn other things 🧑, in fact, I’m an IT enthusiast 💻, it’s kind of obvious with my repositories 🧩.
